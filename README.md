Machine learning VS Deep Learning 

# Machine Learning and Deep Learning: Differences and Applications

## Objective
To demonstrate the conceptual and practical differences between traditional machine learning and deep learning, showing how each approach is applied to real-world problems depending on data type, scale, and complexity.

## Description / Process
This artifact explores how **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** solve different types of problems.  
According to *“Machine Learning Explained in 100 Seconds”* (Fireship, 2021), traditional ML models such as **Logistic Regression** and **Naive Bayes** perform well when datasets are structured and labeled — for example, classifying emails as spam or non-spam using text and metadata.  

In contrast, the *AI Multiple* (2024) article explains how **Deep Learning** models, particularly **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, are used in medical image diagnosis tasks such as detecting cancer or lung disease from X-ray or MRI scans. These systems handle unstructured image data where manual feature engineering is impractical.  

This comparison shows that ML excels in structured and smaller datasets, while DL is designed for complex, large-scale data such as images, audio, and video.

## Value Proposition
Understanding when to apply ML or DL allows data scientists and engineers to choose the right tools for specific use cases.  
This improves computational efficiency, enhances model accuracy, and helps deploy smarter AI-driven solutions faster.  
It also builds a foundation for scaling models in production across diverse data environments.

##  Reflection
Working on this artifact helped strengthen my understanding of how model selection depends on the data’s nature and the project goal.  
In my engineering and analytics work, I apply this thinking when deciding whether structured data problems require classic ML or when deep learning provides a better solution for complex, unstructured information.  
This balance between efficiency and adaptability is critical to building scalable, real-world AI systems that deliver meaningful insights.
